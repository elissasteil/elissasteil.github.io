            <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
            <div class="empty-line"></div>
            <p>I'm a rising junior at William & Mary, earning my Bachelor of Science in Integrative Conservation with a minor in Data Science. I am passionate about bridging the gap between science and society and hope to do so by communicating complex scientific ideas through data visualization, illustration, and journalism.</p>
            <p>In my academic pursuits, I've explored the intersection of climate change and data science, honing my skills in various tools and technologies. As an Environmental Science/GIS intern with Noblis and through my data science coursework, I've worked with ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, Python, and R (particularly tmaps and ggplot), HTML, and web scraping, leveraging these tools to analyze and visualize data effectively.</p>
            <p>In addition to my proficiency in effective communication, my passion for the environment and conservation has been a driving force in my professional journey. Drawing from a diverse array of work experiences and academic coursework, I have honed my skills in copyediting and nonfiction writing, with a strong focus on advocating for environmental sustainability through literature. I am deeply committed to delivering engaging content that not only informs but also motivates audiences to join the cause of environmental stewardship.</p>

                    <p>This map was created in Spring 2024 for my Geovisualization & Cartography course. I was given a large dataset from the US Agricultural Census and the US Census. I used different geoprocessing tools to calculate the density of farms, the mean center, create a Getis-Ord GI* Hot-Spot Analysis, and find the average age of farmers per county. Non-continental states were omitted to avoid compromising the mean center map.</p>

                    <p>Note: While the data utilized to construct this habitat suitability model is authentic, it is important to highlight that the criteria employed are not suitable for accurately assessing the cultivation potential of cannabis.</p>

                    <p>This map was created in Spring 2024 for a semester-long research project with the Institute for Integrative Conservation at William & Mary. In partnership with a local non-profit, my research partner and I developed a habitat suitability model based on the state's new ConserveVirginia v3.0 plan. In addition to using other data from Virginia's Department of Conservation and Recreation, we identified the parcels within the partner organization's service area that were optimal for conservation easements. This simple layout was created to accompany our raw data files and data dictionary, allowing the partner organization to get a quick understanding of the data.</p>
